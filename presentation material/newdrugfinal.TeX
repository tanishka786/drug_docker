\section{Introduction}
Keeping drugs safe, legitimate, and intact along the supply chain is a major concern for the pharmaceutical sector. Problems including mishandled drugs, counterfeit drugs, and a lack of transparency present major health hazards to patients.  Traditional supply chain systems often fail to provide the necessary transparency and traceability, making it difficult to ensure drug safety from manufacturing to end-user distribution.This project presents a blockchain-powered solution that establishes a transparent, decentralized, and immutable ledger to securely track every transaction in the pharmaceutical supply chain. By integrating Ganache for blockchain simulation and MetaMask for account management, the system enables seamless stakeholder interactions while ensuring real-time tracking of drug movement—from raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, and final retail.

At the heart of this system are smart contracts, which automate and enforce verification at every point of the supply chain, reducing human error and assuring secure, timely transfers. The technology improves not only openness and traceability but also regulatory compliance by providing an immutable audit trail for health authorities. This considerably reduces the possibility of fake medications getting into the supply chain.This blockchain-based method ensures accountability at every stage by giving all parties involved—manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and regulators—access to real-time, tamper-proof data. The ability to quickly confirm the security and legitimacy of the medications they buy benefits end users and promotes confidence in the pharmaceutical industry. The fragmentation, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency in the current pharmaceutical supply chain techniques increase the risk of counterfeit goods and create regulatory obstacles. Outdated paper-based documentation and siloed digital systems hinder real-time tracking and data visibility, making it challenging to verify drug authenticity and comply with strict regulations such as DSCSA and FMD.

A blockchain-based solution revolutionizes the pharmaceutical supply chain by introducing a secure, decentralized ledger that enables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time tracking of drugs at every stage.
    \item Enhanced drug authenticity verification to prevent counterfeits.
    \item Streamlined compliance with regulatory standards.
    \item Improved operational efficiency across the supply chain.
\end{itemize}

By securing the entire lifecycle of pharmaceuticals, this system drastically reduces the risk of counterfeit drugs, enhances regulatory adherence, and builds a safer, more reliable, and efficient pharmaceutical supply chain. 

To further strengthen security, the project also implements a college student ID-based verification system, ensuring that only authorized students from specific campuses can access the application. This feature prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data, reinforcing security while maintaining a seamless user experience.
This blockchain-driven approach not only transforms supply chain management but also sets a new standard for security, transparency, and trust in the pharmaceutical industry.


\section{Literature Survey}
This study introduces an advanced blockchain-based approach for improving transparency, security, and traceability in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The suggested solution guarantees safe medication transportation from the acquisition of raw materials to retail distribution by utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, Ganache for blockchain simulation, and MetaMask for account administration. In contrast to traditional frameworks, this decentralized method reduces vulnerabilities, creates an unchangeable audit trail, guarantees regulatory compliance, and increases consumer trust in pharmaceutical products. 
[1].
The use of blockchain technology in supply chain management has been the subject of numerous investigations. Research on using Hyperledger Fabric for secure transactions has shown promise in enhancing pharmaceutical logistics security; nevertheless, these methods frequently lack scalability and real-time adaptation. [2, 3]. Moreover, technologies such as encrypted QR codes and RFID have been employed for drug traceability; however, they remain reliant on centralized verification mechanisms [4, 5]. Studies such as Drugledger have introduced service segmentation strategies to enhance data authenticity and privacy [6], while Medledger has utilized Hyperledger Fabric to establish permissioned blockchain networks for secure transactions [7]. Despite these advancements, many of these solutions remain theoretical, lack AI-driven automation, and are restricted to Windows-based environments, limiting their flexibility [8, 9].
The proposed system addresses these limitations by incorporating advanced technologies. Unlike prior studies, this research integrates Dockerization, enabling seamless deployment across Linux, macOS, and Windows, thereby ensuring cross-platform compatibility and enhanced accessibility. Additionally, the system leverages an AI-powered chatbot to provide real-time updates, automate responses, and facilitate decision-making for stakeholders . These innovations contribute to a more scalable, intelligent, and practical blockchain-based pharmaceutical tracking system, establishing a new standard for supply chain management.



\section{Methodology}
The blockchain-based pharmaceutical supply chain solution's implementation architecture consists of numerous components that work together to create a safe, efficient, and user-friendly platform for drug tracking. The architecture's modular form makes it easier to scale and maintain. The main elements and their interactions are depicted in the block figure further down, which also shows the application's methodology as shown in Fig. 1.

\section{Results}
To set up the system, first connect Metamask Fig. 4 to the Ganache blockchain by starting the workspace you created, and entering the Metamask password to initiate the connection. Ganache will then display 10 Ethereum accounts as shown in Fig. 3. In the settings, you can see the workspace details and confirm the connection with Truffle's configuration file, where the server connects to the specified host and port. Only the owner can perform registration by importing accounts from Ganache using private keys. The owner adds various actors like the raw material supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and retailer by registering their details, such as name, location, and Ethereum address.  


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/Fig 5.5.png}
    \caption{Ganache Account details page.}
    \label{fig3}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/Fig 5.10.png}
    \caption{Metamask Account of actors.}
    \label{fig4}
\end{figure}



After registering the actors, the owner can add the medicine to be manufactured. Each actor performs their specific task using their respective accounts, such as the supplier providing raw materials by adding the medicine ID. Once all tasks are completed, the medicine can be tracked by entering its ID, allowing any actor to check its status as needed. This setup ensures clear roles and responsibilities among all involved parties while enabling efficient tracking of medicines.
