### 1. **Project Title**

     - Drug chain supply management system using blockchain

### 2. **Created by**

     - Tanishka Das
     - Pallavi Dhandar
     - Jatush Hingu
     - Akash Nadar

### 3. **Description**

     -  This website is a comprehensive platform developed to ensure the drug supply chain's transparency, security, and efficiency. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, the platform provides
        an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The backend is powered by Node.js and MongoDB, ensuring robust data handling and real-time processing. The blockchain component, developed using Solidity and
        deployed on the Sepolia testnet, guarantees immutable and secure transactions, tracking drugs from manufacturer to consumer. Docker is used for containerization, ensuring the application is scalable,
        portable, and easy to deploy across different environments.

### 4. **Features**

     - Secure tracking of drugs from manufacturing to delivery
     - Tamper-proof records
     - Real-time monitoring and verification
     - Compliance with regulations
     - Access controls for different stakeholders

### 5. **Technology Stack**

     - Blockchain platform: Ethereum, Sepolia (Test Net)
     - Smart contract languages: Solidity, python
     - Frontend technologies: Js, HTML, CSS
     - Backend technologies: Node.js
     - Database:  MongoDB
     - Metamask for test Notworks (Sepolia)
     - Docker for containerization

### 14. **OG WORKING MEETHOD :::::::::**

      - BEFORE WE CAN MIGRATE OUR CONTRACT TO BLOCKCHAIN WE NEED TO HAVE A BLOCKCHAIN RUNNING
      - So for that we will use "GANACHE" 
      - Migrate your contract to blockchain using truffle migrate
      - Then we will use "WEB3" to interact with blockchain @@@@@@@@@@@@@@ SU SHIBAINU "
