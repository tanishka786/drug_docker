### 1. **Project Title**

   - Drug Guardian

### 2. **Description**

   This website is a comprehensive platform developed to ensure the transparency, security, and efficiency of the drug supply chain. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, it provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The blockchain component, developed using Solidity and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, guarantees immutable and secure transactions, tracking drugs from the manufacturer to the consumer. Docker is used for containerization, ensuring scalability, portability, and easy deployment across different environments. Additionally, Truffle and Ganache UI have been utilized for blockchain development and testing. We also integrated an AI chatbot to enhance user interaction and support within the platform.

### 3. **Features**

   - Secure tracking of drugs from manufacturing to delivery
   - Tamper-proof records
   - Real-time monitoring and verification
   - Compliance with regulations
   - Access controls for different stakeholders
   - AI chatbot for user support

### 4. **Technology Stack**

   - Blockchain platform: Ethereum, Geth (Testnet) 
   - Smart contract languages: Solidity 
   - Frontend technologies: React JS
   - Backend technologies: Node.js
   - Metamask for Geth Testnet interaction ( by adding network manually)
   - Docker for containerization
   - Truffle for smart contract development and migration

   ```bash
   yarn start
   npm start
   ```

### 6. **Usage**

   - **Interacting with the blockchain network**:
     - Access the Metamask wallet linked to the Geth Testnet to monitor transactions
     - Use the AI chatbot to guide you through the process
   - **Managing drug supply chain records**:
     - View and update drug records on the platform, which are securely stored and tracked on the blockchain
   - **Verifying transactions**:
     - Verify the authenticity of transactions using the blockchain explorer linked with Sepolia Testnet

### 7. **Smart Contracts**

   - **Description**:
     - The smart contracts handle drug creation, tracking, and delivery verification
   - **Deployment**:
     - Contracts are deployed on the Sepolia testnet using Truffle and Ganache UI
   - **Functions**:
     - Functions include adding drugs to the supply chain, tracking their movement, and verifying delivery
